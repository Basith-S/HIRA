// Output guard — the model proposes, the host verifies.
//
// Measured on 138 held-out events (osava-ft/hallucination_check.py), the
// fine-tune never invents a severity and never contradicts its own verdict.
// What it does do:
//
//   * cite only reassuring evidence for an alert — 49 of 73 alerts said, in
//     effect, "signed by Microsoft, runs from System32, therefore malicious".
//     The verdict was usually right; the stated reason was worthless, and an
//     analyst reading it learns to distrust the tool. This was trained in:
//     56% of the training targets pair a threat verdict with only exculpatory
//     indicators.
//   * occasionally reach for an indicator key outside the closed vocabulary
//     (1 in 138 — `remote_command`, for a netcat reverse shell the vocabulary
//     has no key for), or quote evidence that is not in the event (1 in 138).
//
// None of these change the verdict, so none of them are allowed to either.
// The severity passes through untouched; what is removed is explanation the
// event does not support. Everything removed is recorded on `guard` so the
// audit trail shows what the model said, not only what survived.
